“Teaching kids to count is fine, but teaching kids what counts is best.” - Bob Talbert
As teachers, we have a lot on our shoulders, and yes, that does mean literally teaching kids their ABCs and their 123s. However, the love and kindness,
and compassion we show in the classroom every day is going a long way too!
It helps our students see the kind of people they can grow up to be!

“I touch the future. I teach.” – Christa McAuliffe
New Hampshire teacher Christa McAuliffe will never be forgotten by the American teaching community for her strength and bravery. 
Before she lost her life in the Challenger explosion in 1986 — a tragedy that claimed the lives of seven crew members on the space shuttle 
— McAuliffe was inspiring teachers with her willingness to leave the comfort of her social studies classroom for outer space as part of NASA’s Teacher in Space Project.
You may not be headed into outer space any time soon, but let’s face it — you too touch the future every day right in your school building.
